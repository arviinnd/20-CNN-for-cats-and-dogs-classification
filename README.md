Subject: use case on convolution neural networks for classification of cats and dogs.
<br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
<br>
We have been given a use case on the classification of images as dogs or cats using convolution neural networks. We create training and 
test directories with 2000 and 1000 images respectively form the given dataset. We use the keras module. We start by using 32 2D filters
in the convolution layer and changing the input dimensions of images to 150x150x3. We add a pooling layer with filter size of 2x2. We 
flatten the matrices obtained and add dense layers with 128 and 1 output dimensions respectively. Since this is a classification problem, 
we finish by having a dense layer with output dimension as 1 and activation function as sigmoid function. We use the 'adam' solver and 
binary_cross_entorpy for modelling loss. We get a training accuracy of 76% and a test accuracy of 71 %. We plot training loss and accuracy 
with the number of epochs.
